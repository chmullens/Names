    "### \"Hey I know that name!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "It's been talked about so often times that it's hard to find an original source, but the idea of \"unique but familiar\" is all over in marketing. Perhaps the most famous version is \"Most Advanced Yet Acceptable\", coined by Raymond Loewy. Basically, people like things that are new, but fit somewhere they know. [(Atlantic article on Loewy)](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/01/what-makes-things-cool/508772/)\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, my goal is to help users find names that \"fit\". If a name 1) feels familiar, and 2) tells you quickly that the named person is likely from a specific time period or age range, that's the kind of name that I'm looking for. Familiar, but unique enough to give you useful information about the person's age and the year. \n",
    "\n",
    "Say you want to market something to people around 65. Do you want to pick \"Jacob\" as a name in an ad? Probably not. The vast majority of people named \"Jacob\" are under 40. What if you wanted to have a believable name for someone 20-30 in a period piece set in 1990? You don't want \"Cayden\", for example, which is one of the youngest common names, but how do we find names that do fit? By combining actuarial and birth name data, I've built a model that finds them for us. Starting from how many person-years were lived by a given name, in a given age range, in a given year range, we find which names that lived the biggest fraction of their lives in that window. We then combine this measure with the name's total window person-years, to get a composite score that uses both how common and how characteristic a given name is for that time period and age range. \n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting interactive tool is the primary \"deliverable\" of this project. Unfortunately, the database is too large for most low-cost hosting, so I haven't implemented a web app to handle it. The code currently generates a PNG and a `plotly` figure, which can both be easily embedded in html. \n",
    "\n",
    "From there, I explored more interesting analysis, such as clustering names by similarity. In the prior analysis, I found that grouping names that were pronounced identically provides related but significantly different results than keeping names separated alphabetically. In short, \"Darrin\" vs. \"Darren\", for example, \n",

I am in the progress of optimizing this to work from a derived set of data, rather than calculating the full characteristic values for every name at every call. Currently, it uses a pair of matrices around (25000 | 40000) x 140 x 180 (~25k rows for male names, 40k rows for female names) which is a lot, but it could get by on the set of names/properties for each potential window and potential age. If I constrain the windows for year and age range to either 5 or 10 years and only save the top 100 names, then it's a (135+130) x (135+130) x 100 matrix for M and F each, cutting it down from >1 billion elements to ~15 million. \n",

    "\n",
    "### Notes on name similarity clustering:\n",
    "\n",
    "**The goal:** Cluster names based on how similarly they are spelled or pronounced. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with the spelling, since the pronunciation similarity has additional layers of complexity. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with the spelling; I'll be using Levenshtein distance as a starting point, which is a very convenient measure of how similar two words are to one another, also known as the \"edit distance\". It doesn't take into account the fact that there some letters are more similar to one another than others (i.e. \"a\" is drastically more like \"e\" than \"q\"), but it's a great start, and I can update the distance algorithm as I go. (The more complex letter similarity is probably most appropriately handled in the pronunciation clustering, anyway.)\n",
    "\n",
    "So! The core tech here is going to be **affinity propagation**. For that, we need similarity measures between each pair of words, which to reiterate will be the Levenshtein distance. \n",
    "\n",
    "Minor problem: Using the current set of names, the number of comparisons is big. The **total number of comparisons is O(n²)**, which is not good when you have a set of 100,000 names, so I'm pruning the dataset. I'll be focusing on the most relevant names, i.e. those which met a certain threshold of use. One possible threshold: maximum number of people who have had that name at any time. You can see in the plot below what this ends up looking like. You can also see that the name distribution follows a pretty clear pattern. \n",
    "\n",
    "In short, to keep our number of comparisons reasonable, **we'll limit it based on peak holders alive.** We can calculate which clusters additional names would fit in pretty easily, but for the clustering itself, this may be close to the outer limits of what we can practically do with affinity propagation using this precomputed distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**PROBABLE FUTURE ADDITION:**  \n",
    "Pre-group names with IDENTICAL predicted pronunciations, THEN get the top set. That will, for example, catch the literally 40 different ways of spelling \"Abigail\" under a single umbrella, or the \"Brayden/Breighdon\" etc. name clan."

With normalized Levenshtein  lot of similar distances between different names, which is likely to cause problems for any clustering method. For spelling, for example, \"Stephen\" and \"Steven\" (Levenshtein distance of 2) are more similar than \"Chuck\" and \"Church\" (also 2). \n",
    "\n",
    "There are several ways that this problem could be approached. First, we could implement a similarity metric using the ARPABET pronunciations. The ARPABET model contains useful information about sound similarity, based on overlap between the characters present in each sound's code. That might be best accomplished by measuring distance on multiple levels, since you'd be calculating distance between individual sounds, and distance between collections of sounds. \n",
    "\n",
    "I'd have to think more about how to reconcile that, but one relatively simple way would be doing normalized character difference rather than total character substitution. For example, the \"A\" in \"Adrian\" is represented by \"EY1\", compared to the \"A\" in \"Andrew\" which is \"AE1\". To convert using standard Levenshtein insertion/deletion/substitution between these two ARPABET representations of the characters, we could make one deletion (EY1 -> E1) and one insertion (E1 -> AE1). To go from EY1 to AE1, then, would be a Levenshtein distance of 2, out of a maximum of 3 to replace every character. We could then normalize this 2-edit distance to the fraction of the maximum edit distance, since this set of characters represents a single sound. That would give us a distance of 0.66. \n",
    "\n",
    "That's not great, since it gives a distance of 0.66 between the two characters despite pretty similar sounds, but it's more effective than the full 1.00 distance that IPA pronunciation would give. We could also ignore the order of the letters, and do a simple character-similarity measure, which would give us a 0.33 distance, but I'd have to look into whether this would give spurious correlations between unrelated sounds. Sound insertion/deletion would still be a binary scale, but substitutions could be more nuanced. Unfortunately, this solution would also require a novel Levenshtein-like implementation to use this multi-level system, or similarly in-depth investigation of alternative solutions to see which could be adapted for this purpose. That's a little beyond the scope of the project. \n",
    "\n",
    "More effective than developing a new multi-level version of the Levenshtein distance, it would be easier to characterize how similar the IPA sounds are, and use a single-level Levenshtein with weighted substitutions. This is also not trivial. I was able to find a paper that looks like it does a good job measuring how far apart different vowels are using both text-similarity and pronunciation-similarity methods, [by Wieling et al (2012)](http://www.martijnwieling.nl/files/WielingMargarethaNerbonne2012.pdf). Unfortunately, while the methods are fascinating and the results look good, the paper does not provide a straighforward distance matrix. The sound distances could be partially reconstructed from Figure 3, but, again, starting to get beyond the intended scope of this project. \n",
    "\n",
    "In either case, I'd need to use weighted Levenshtein at the top level, where differences between sounds are not identical. Fortunately, this problem is fairly well-studied, and there appear to be [multiple toolboxes that implement it](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6080958/ocr-weighted-levenshtein-distance), such as the [\"weighted-levenshtein\" package](https://pypi.org/project/weighted-levenshtein/). \n",
    "\n",
    "I've laid out a potential detailed solution for calculating pronunciation similarity, but **implementing these high-effort solutions is beyond the scope of this project.** Instead, I used a very \"data science\"-type solution above: Solve the problem in a passable way using several different methods, then build a model that throws them together. Here, I'm calculating distance based on spelling character distance, IPA character distance, and ARPABET character difference. I slightly decreased the weight of the pronunciation measures relative to spelling, since both should (theoretically) be measuring the same thing, and I wanted to keep the model somewhat more balanced between spelling and pronunciation. \n",

I'd need to extend this significantly to allow next-year prediction (i.e. generating projected name-cluster data), but it's a clear sign that we can reasonably track some trends for relatively popular names. To use the prior model for predictions, we'd have to generate synthetic cluster-trend data, which is feasible. For example, let's plug what we have into a time-series model like ARIMA, which uses the time course of the data to project its future trajectory. This is like to do reasonably well for near-future projection, and we can use that projection to generate the synthetic cluster trends necessary for the linear model to predict. Of course, we could also use the ARIMA directly on each name, but that would take hours for the full set of names compared to seconds for the linear model, and would also discard the information we can calculate about how names trend together. \n",

    "Modifications: I should do a log transform on the data early on, to convert it closer to a normal-distribution range of values, which would respond more appropriately to linear fitting. That's going near the top of the list, it will have a real effect on how well most models can characterize the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Overly-optimistic predictions for near-dead names could be handled better at the individual-name level with ARIMA, despite the drastically slower processing. Similarly, ARIMA would likely also do fairly well avoiding negatives, since the graph tends to flatten as it nears zero. That's largely handled with the transition to yearly change, though. A hybrid model using both could probably do pretty well, but it would be difficult to reasonably fit given the data, and at that point you might want to head into more complex territory like RNN. \n",
    "\n",
    "Anyway, predicting names is inherently a difficult problem. We don't have reliable time components to the signal that we can account for, or a massive pile of datapoints. There are generation-related timing elements, but those are close to random, and how long trends persist may be changing. \n",
    "\n",
    "Pulling in data on name popularity on a state-by-state basis would help quite a bit, bumping our dataset from about 140 datapoints to about 5000 (some state reporting didn't get going until later if I'm recalling right, so it's not quite 140 x 51). It certainly wouldn't solve the problem by itself! State name trends are strongly correlated with national trends, especially as media increasingly moves away from the local level. State data could significantly help, but it will be necessary to use models that account for correlation between variables. \n",
    "\n",
    "Future directions for name trend prediction, in summary:\n",
    "- More in-depth data transformation prior to analysis/modeling (log or Box-Cox transform built into `pmdarima`, for example)\n",
    "- Consider multivariate autoregression (i.e. VAR) to model multivariate time series data more effectively (not likely to make the ARIMA fitting feasible for individual names without a days-long run)  \n",
    "- Consider reweighting recent years. Names with a strong recent increase are at a disadvantage in threshold, despite strong likelihood of continuing future presence. Could weigh name prevalence more highly in the last 3-5 years, for example, both to avoid cutting them off at the threshold stage and to increase the attention the model pays to recent trends? Something to consider.\n",
    "- Add state data to improve models (at minimum should reduce year-level noise, important now that it's predicting based on yearly change)\n",
    "- Toss this into an actual user interface/prediction engine. "

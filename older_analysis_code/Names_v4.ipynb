I am in the progress of optimizing this to work from a derived set of data, rather than calculating the full characteristic values for every name at every call. Currently, it uses a pair of matrices around (25000 | 40000) x 140 x 180 (~25k rows for male names, 40k rows for female names) which is a lot, but it could get by on the set of names/properties for each potential window and potential age. If I constrain the windows for year and age range to either 5 or 10 years and only save the top 100 names, then it's a (135+130) x (135+130) x 100 matrix for M and F each, cutting it down from >1 billion elements to ~15 million. \n",

    "In short, based on the properties of the names we know of, predict whether a name will increase or decrease in a given year. Currently on version 1, a simple Ridge. Below are notes on how the clustering will work and future improvements and projects that would improve the function. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notes on name similarity clustering:\n",
    "\n",
    "**The goal:** Cluster names based on how similarly they are spelled or pronounced. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with the spelling, since the pronunciation similarity has additional layers of complexity. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with the spelling; I'll be using Levenshtein distance as a starting point, which is a very convenient measure of how similar two words are to one another, also known as the \"edit distance\". It doesn't take into account the fact that there some letters are more similar to one another than others (i.e. \"a\" is drastically more like \"e\" than \"q\"), but it's a great start, and I can update the distance algorithm as I go. (The more complex letter similarity is probably most appropriately handled in the pronunciation clustering, anyway.)\n",
    "\n",
    "So! The core tech here is going to be **affinity propagation**. For that, we need similarity measures between each pair of words, which to reiterate will be the Levenshtein distance. \n",
    "\n",
    "Minor problem: Using the current set of names, the number of comparisons is big. The **total number of comparisons is O(n²)**, which is not good when you have a set of 100,000 names. I'm going to have to prune this. I'll be focusing on the most relevant names, i.e. those which met a certain threshold of use. One possible threshold: maximum number of people who have had that name at any time. You can see in the plot below what this ends up looking like. You can also see that the name distribution follows a pretty clear pattern. \n",
    "\n",
    "In short, to keep our number of comparisons reasonable, **we'll limit it based on peak holders alive.** We can calculate which clusters additional names would fit in pretty easily, but for the clustering itself, this may be close to the outer limits of what we can practically do with affinity propagation using this precomputed distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**PROBABLE FUTURE ADDITION:**  \n",
    "Pre-group names with IDENTICAL predicted pronunciations, THEN get the top set. That will, for example, catch the literally 40 different ways of spelling \"Abigail\" under a single umbrella, or the \"Brayden/Breighdon\" etc. name clan."

For example, the \"A\" in \"Adrian\" is \"EY1\", where the \"A\" in \"Andrew\" is \"AE1\". That would be a Levenshtein distance of 2 (one subtraction to E1, one addition to AE1, or other ways to get there). Okay so that's not necessarily the greatest, since it would give a normalized Levenshtein of 0.66 (2/3 difference) when the sounds are reasonably similar, but it's still better than the complete difference that IPA would give. Character addition/subtraction would still be a binary scale. \n",

They're actually reasonable predictions given the past history of the name in most cases! Even hitting a score of zero (performing as well as the actual mean of the last five years) is quite good. There are a few notable problems, though. For example, the estimates are often overly-optimistic for names that are currently in a long-term low.

    "With careful variable preprocessing, a simple linear model does a surprisingly good job of tracking name trends without drastic overfitting. I'd need to extend this significantly to allow next-year prediction (i.e. generating projected name-cluster data), but it's a clear sign that we can reasonably track some trends for relatively popular names. To use the prior model for predictions, we'd have to generate synthetic cluster-trend data, which is feasible. For example, let's plug what we have into a time-series model like ARIMA, which uses the time course of the data to project its future trajectory. This is like to do reasonably well for near-future projection, and we can use that projection to generate the synthetic cluster trends necessary for the linear model to predict. Of course, we could also use the ARIMA directly on each name, but that would take hours for the full set of names compared to seconds for the linear model, and would also discard the information we can calculate about how names trend together. \n",

Could weigh name prevalence more highly in the last 3-5 years, for example, both to avoid cutting them off at the threshold stage and to increase the attention the model pays to recent trends? Something to consider.\n",

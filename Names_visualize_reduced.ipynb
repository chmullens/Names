    "In short, based on the properties of the names we know of, predict whether a name will increase or decrease in a given year. Currently on version 1, a simple Ridge. Below are notes on how the clustering will work and future improvements and projects that would improve the function. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notes on name similarity clustering:\n",
    "\n",
    "**The goal:** Cluster names based on how similarly they are spelled or pronounced. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with the spelling, since the pronunciation similarity has additional layers of complexity. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with the spelling; I'll be using Levenshtein distance as a starting point, which is a very convenient measure of how similar two words are to one another, also known as the \"edit distance\". It doesn't take into account the fact that there some letters are more similar to one another than others (i.e. \"a\" is drastically more like \"e\" than \"q\"), but it's a great start, and I can update the distance algorithm as I go. (The more complex letter similarity is probably most appropriately handled in the pronunciation clustering, anyway.)\n",
    "\n",
    "So! The core tech here is going to be **affinity propagation**. For that, we need similarity measures between each pair of words, which to reiterate will be the Levenshtein distance. \n",
    "\n",
    "Minor problem: Using the current set of names, the number of comparisons is big. The **total number of comparisons is O(n²)**, which is not good when you have a set of 100,000 names, so I'm pruning the dataset. I'll be focusing on the most relevant names, i.e. those which met a certain threshold of use. One possible threshold: maximum number of people who have had that name at any time. You can see in the plot below what this ends up looking like. You can also see that the name distribution follows a pretty clear pattern. \n",
    "\n",
    "In short, to keep our number of comparisons reasonable, **we'll limit it based on peak holders alive.** We can calculate which clusters additional names would fit in pretty easily, but for the clustering itself, this may be close to the outer limits of what we can practically do with affinity propagation using this precomputed distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**PROBABLE FUTURE ADDITION:**  \n",
    "Pre-group names with IDENTICAL predicted pronunciations, THEN get the top set. That will, for example, catch the literally 40 different ways of spelling \"Abigail\" under a single umbrella, or the \"Brayden/Breighdon\" etc. name clan."

For example, the \"A\" in \"Adrian\" is \"EY1\", where the \"A\" in \"Andrew\" is \"AE1\". That would be a Levenshtein distance of 2 (one subtraction to E1, one addition to AE1, or other ways to get there). Okay so that's not necessarily the greatest, since it would give a normalized Levenshtein of 0.66 (2/3 difference) when the sounds are reasonably similar, but it's still better than the complete difference that IPA would give. Character addition/subtraction would still be a binary scale. \n",

There are a few notable problems, though. For example, the estimates are often overly-optimistic for names that are currently in a long-term low.

    "With careful variable preprocessing, a simple linear model does a surprisingly good job of tracking name trends without drastic overfitting. I'd need to extend this significantly to allow next-year prediction (i.e. generating projected name-cluster data), but it's a clear sign that we can reasonably track some trends for relatively popular names. To use the prior model for predictions, we'd have to generate synthetic cluster-trend data, which is feasible. For example, let's plug what we have into a time-series model like ARIMA, which uses the time course of the data to project its future trajectory. This is like to do reasonably well for near-future projection, and we can use that projection to generate the synthetic cluster trends necessary for the linear model to predict. Of course, we could also use the ARIMA directly on each name, but that would take hours for the full set of names compared to seconds for the linear model, and would also discard the information we can calculate about how names trend together. \n",

    "Modifications: I should do a log transform on the data early on, to convert it closer to a normal-distribution range of values, which would respond more appropriately to linear fitting. That's going near the top of the list, it will have a real effect on how well most models can characterize the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Overly-optimistic predictions for near-dead names could be handled better at the individual-name level with ARIMA, despite the drastically slower processing. Similarly, ARIMA would likely also do fairly well avoiding negatives, since the graph tends to flatten as it nears zero. That's largely handled with the transition to yearly change, though. A hybrid model using both could probably do pretty well, but it would be difficult to reasonably fit given the data, and at that point you might want to head into more complex territory like RNN. \n",
    "\n",
    "Anyway, predicting names is inherently a difficult problem. We don't have reliable time components to the signal that we can account for, or a massive pile of datapoints. There are generation-related timing elements, but those are close to random, and how long trends persist may be changing. \n",
    "\n",
    "Pulling in data on name popularity on a state-by-state basis would help quite a bit, bumping our dataset from about 140 datapoints to about 5000 (some state reporting didn't get going until later if I'm recalling right, so it's not quite 140 x 51). It certainly wouldn't solve the problem by itself! State name trends are strongly correlated with national trends, especially as media increasingly moves away from the local level. State data could significantly help, but it will be necessary to use models that account for correlation between variables. \n",
    "\n",
    "Future directions for name trend prediction, in summary:\n",
    "- More in-depth data transformation prior to analysis/modeling (log or Box-Cox transform built into `pmdarima`, for example)\n",
    "- Consider multivariate autoregression (i.e. VAR) to model multivariate time series data more effectively (not likely to make the ARIMA fitting feasible for individual names without a days-long run)  \n",
    "- Consider reweighting recent years. Names with a strong recent increase are at a disadvantage in threshold, despite strong likelihood of continuing future presence. Could weigh name prevalence more highly in the last 3-5 years, for example, both to avoid cutting them off at the threshold stage and to increase the attention the model pays to recent trends? Something to consider.\n",
    "- Add state data to improve models (at minimum should reduce year-level noise, important now that it's predicting based on yearly change)\n",
    "- Toss this into an actual user interface/prediction engine. "
